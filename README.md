# SchizoPredict: Schizophrenia Disease Detection

Welcome to the SchizoPredict GitHub repository! SchizoPredict is a cutting-edge project aimed at revolutionizing the early detection and diagnosis of schizophrenia, a complex mental disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Our mission is to harness the power of machine learning algorithms and advanced data analysis techniques to pave the way for more personalized and effective mental health care.

## The Challenge of Schizophrenia Detection

Schizophrenia is a complex mental disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and diagnosis of schizophrenia can significantly improve patient outcomes and quality of life. Schizophrenia remains a significant challenge in the field of mental health. Its symptoms can be subtle, ambiguous, and often overlap with other conditions, making accurate diagnosis difficult, particularly during the early stages of the disease. Sadly, delayed diagnosis can lead to missed opportunities for intervention and appropriate treatment, impacting patients' overall well-being and potentially exacerbating the condition.

## Our Vision

At SchizoPredict, we envision a future where timely diagnosis and early intervention become the norm, empowering healthcare professionals to identify individuals at risk of developing schizophrenia with unprecedented accuracy. By identifying warning signs and risk factors at an early stage, we aim to reduce the burden of the disease and enhance the quality of life for affected individuals and their families.

## Feature Importance Analysis

One of the critical aspects of our research is the in-depth analysis of feature importance within the LightGBM model. We have carefully examined the significance of various features extracted from EEG signals during the training process. By calculating importance scores assigned by the LightGBM model to each feature, we have identified the top-ranked features that play a pivotal role in schizophrenia detection.

This analysis has enabled us to pinpoint the most crucial biomarkers or patterns present within EEG signals that are indicative of schizophrenia. By understanding the importance of these features, we can gain valuable insights into the neural activity patterns associated with the disorder.

## Attention Mechanisms

To further enhance our model's interpretability, we have integrated attention mechanisms into the LightGBM architecture. These attention mechanisms allow the model to focus on specific regions or components of the EEG signals that are highly relevant for accurate schizophrenia detection.

Through attention weights, we can precisely identify the temporal or spectral aspects of EEG signals that contribute significantly to the classification process. This approach not only improves the model's accuracy but also provides interpretable insights into the salient regions or patterns that guide the model's decision-making.

## Visualization Techniques

Visualization techniques are invaluable tools in understanding the learned representations within the LightGBM model. We have employed various visualization methods, including heatmaps, to highlight the specific regions or frequencies within the EEG signals that significantly influence the model's predictions.

These visualizations offer a comprehensive view of the spatial and spectral characteristics associated with schizophrenia. They reveal the discriminative patterns captured by the model and aid researchers and clinicians in gaining a deeper understanding of the neurological basis of the disorder.

Our project's emphasis on feature importance analysis, attention mechanisms, and visualization techniques represents a significant step forward in making schizophrenia detection more transparent, explainable, and scientifically grounded. By combining cutting-edge machine learning techniques with domain-specific knowledge, we strive to pave the way for more effective, personalized, and compassionate mental health care.

We invite researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts alike to explore our project, contribute to its development, and join us in our quest to revolutionize schizophrenia detection and improve the lives of millions affected by this complex mental disorder.
